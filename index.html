              I've been working in sales and marketing roles for the past 6 years, and have a love for startups. I was born and raised in Louisville, KY, but moved to beautiful San Diego in the summer of 2013. I like spending time outdoors, hiking, hanging out with friends and family, coffee, craft beer and trying new things. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My formal education is in psychology, but I have a strong interest in all things tech. In October of 2013, I launched my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.32best.com">own startup</a> with my husband to help buyers and sellers find top real estate agents in their market. I'm determined to live an extraordinary life and want to work on awesome things with awesome people. If you're interested in talking with me, please feel free to reach out anytime.

                  Worked with my co-founder to build the business from the ground up. We created a platform that helps buyers and sellers find the best real estate agents in their city by algorithmically analyzing customer reviews, social media engagement and web presence. Agents that ranked above our threshold score were displayed on the site and given the option to advertise.

          <p>
            I chose to pursue a degree in psychology because I've always been interested in the way people think, make choices, and learn. I really enjoyed working through the program and found behavioral psychology particularly interesting. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a full time student taking between 15-21 credit hours each semester, I also worked over 30 hours each week during my junior and senior year of college. I believe this helped me build a strong work ethic and prepared me future opportunities.
